Here I go …
Сold and snow.
I’ve opened that door.

There’s no chance
To make any sense.
I think it is not yours.

Here we go …
Cold and snow.
One day I closed the door.

Everything
Will be cleared
Up in the morning.

What should I have done
To eclipse the sun?
I need to be frozen,
Untouched by the sky.

What should I have done
To escape and run?
No need to conquer,
No need to fight.

Snowstorm.
I really enjoy
Winter’s unique warmth.

Here I go …
Here you go.
I don’t want to be here anymore.

I liked this dance.
I liked this chance.
But you’ll always be a guest.

But never mind.
And I’m all right.
I think I need some rest.

What should I have done
To eclipse the sun?
I need to be frozen,
Untouched by the sky.

What should I have done
To escape and run?
No need to conquer,
No need to fight.
