We used to be away from home.
We left the keys in another dimension.
The future seems adventuresome,
We need to keep an eye on this for the sake of prevention.

We don't anticipate any good news.
We are unable to alter your rules.
We can, however (live our lives).
And keep the fire burning in your eyes.

We disappeared into another universe (universe).

We don't have much petrol with us.
But we have a lot of freedom with us (freedom with us).
We will choose our kings and queens.
Your fantasy will become real.
We don't wait for news on our travels.
We simply go through the game levels.

We don't anticipate any good news.
We are unable to alter your rules.
We can, however (live our lives).
And keep the fire (and keep the fire) burning in your eyes.

We disappeared into another universe.
We used the settings and changed the luminance.

We don't have much petrol with us.
We don't have much petrol with us.
We don't have much …
But we have a lot of freedom with us.
