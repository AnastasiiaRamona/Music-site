An idyll. A strength, a will.
So beautiful and so unreal.
An idyll. A strength, a will.
So beautiful and so unreal.

Is that your real life, 
Or just the sketch for your stage?
Dreams dressed up as truth, 
Putting you in a cage.
I look at this every day.
I'm trying trying to leave this way.

They're wearing plaid shirts.
Might as well buy them too.
Fake phrases, fake thoughts.
Do you think that it's true?
Maybe it’s none of mine to say.
I'm trying trying to leave this way.

In the digital age, 
It's so easy to pretend.
All you get are fake smiles, 
Empty words and false friends.
I believe there's something real in you.
I’m hoping I can get that too.

You really need this to feel better.
You really need to send this letter.
I know what you feel.
Just stop living in a dream.
