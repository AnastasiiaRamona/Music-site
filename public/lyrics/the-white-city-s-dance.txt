My ideas are broader now.
It's an amazing vibe of a light town.

Nostalgia for homeland.
A very sad musician-slash-band.

One more cup of coffee,
It all makes sense.
It all makes sense.

Can you feel it softly?

It’s the White City’s dance.

I wanna kill my ambitions.
I’d like to be just a musician.

I wanna get grounded.
The White City is my friend.

Can you feel it softly?
It’s the White City’s dance.
It’s the White City’s dance.
