You are the hero of your life,
You find your life among the pages.
You gave up on the strife.
You haven't stopped imagining.

You are fatigued but at ease.
You are a detective in your soul.
You wanted to change the growth of trees.
But you found out you are too small (for it, for it).

Your story is important to me (is important to me).
This is the way to be free.
This is the way,
This is the way,
This is the way,
This is the way …

A treasure, your detective soul.
Being yourself is the main goal.
Your thoughts hurt.
And around you there is a desert.

Resolve the last puzzle:
Find the reason to be here.
Be calm, don't hustle.
You have the whole life for this (for this, for this).
 
There are things you cannot change (you cannot change).
Just to broaden your range.
You cannot change,
You cannot change,
You cannot change,
You cannot change … 

Everyone of us lives in a novel.
Everyone has their own travel.
However, everyone's puzzle is the same:
Find the reason to be here.
