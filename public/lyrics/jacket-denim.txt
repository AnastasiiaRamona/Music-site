Everything is all right,
But I'm feeling ill tonight.
I'm feeling ill tonight. Oh, no.

My flowers are dying.
I’m crying. I’m crying.

Hey guys, look at me:
Fuckin perfect jacket denim.
The only thing that brings me joy.
Oh, right, and a kinder toy.

People will ask what's wrong with me.
It's so jacket denim …

Strange diagnosis.
But I have a good prognosis.

I feel dissolved 
Like shadows slowly swirled.
(It's that time for indie music).
