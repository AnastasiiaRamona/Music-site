Today, today, today …

She was a girl who worked long hours.
She was trying to find some time.
She believed she had special powers.
Whoa, what a delusion.

She finds significance in creation.
She needed him, and that's why he was there.
They crossed the whole other nation.
A fresh dream came to her.

There are moments when I lose control …

Today, today, today …
A new mania struck her.
Today, today, today …
She became like a bird.
Today, today, today …
She wanted to change the world.
(Nothing gets done in a single day).

She can spend hours in front of the computer.
It all makes sense again, she thinks.
When everything goes well, it’s super.
But things aren't always that way.

When she fails, it hurts her.
She is trying to enjoy her life. 
She has moments when she feels like a bird.
Don't touch the stars in the sky.

Today, today, today …
Just take a rest!
Just take a rest.
Take it easy, take it easy, take it easy, 
Write a song about me, about me, about me.
Just take a rest!
Write a song about me, about me, about me.
Just take a rest!
Write a song about me, about me, about me.
