I won’t apologize
For my words, for my place.
I’ll be wise…

If this world
Puts a label,
I’ll be able
To disappear…
 
I’m not a people-pleaser.
As I appreciate others, they should appreciate me.
Everything could be easier
 
If this world
Weren’t so cruel,
I’d have the rule   
And be seen…
 
If I were
More dismissive,
My soul 
Would be clean.
 
If you can’t
Change the world,
Just change 
Your mind.
