My friend, where did you hide your life? 
Two years passed—three, four, or five. 
You're so young and very tired. 

My friend, have you heard the final shot? 
It's very painful and hot. 
Forget, wake up, wake up, step out. 

Your dreams are real. 
Dangers are near, 
but it is all you want. 
It's hidden deep. 
So simply rip,
Do something wrong. 

My friend, everything comes to an end. 
To count the moles on your hand, 
I want you to see the world. 

My friend, don't listen to anyone.
It's only-only your time (don't listen to anyone).
You’re so young; your life is gold.

Your dreams are real. 
Dangers are near, 
but it is all you want. 
It's hidden deep. 
So simply rip,
Do something wrong.

Breathe the air and feel nature. 
Stop talking; leave a question. 
All you need is outside. 
All you need is outside. 

You are the hero of your life. 
Two years passed—three, four, and five. 
Now you woke up from a dream. 
Terrible dream. 

All you need is outside (outside).
