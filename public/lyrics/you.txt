I met you when our world fell apart.
We needed you to find me.
You have become an important part
Of my life. Trust me.

I can dissolve into your arms 
And shut off the outside world.
And you will be surrounded by my charms,
My love.

Don't let me fall, don't let me break.
Keep me strong with every step I take.
I swear that you will be love of my life 
Forever and ever. 

In your blue eyes, I saw the whole world.
My heart holds a vast universe for you.
In your embrace, my dreams unfurled.
It's all about you.
