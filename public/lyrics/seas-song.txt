I hear the sea’s song,
I feel the weight of stones.
I remember it was wrong,
I believed in my hopes.

And this ship decided to sail on,
HE took me on board.
I feel the weight of every stone,
But I hear the sea’s song.

I have never seen the sea,
I have never seen the sea.

My ship will sail endlessly,
Forever and endlessly.

Do you hear the song of the sea?
It’s hurt me but you hurt more.
Again I pour a cap of coffee
And let my heart can’t take it anymore.

I made a mistake that’s hard to fix,
Love and resentment can be mixed.
I want you to be with me on this ship.

I have never seen the sea,
I have never seen the sea.

My ship will sail endlessly,
Forever and endlessly.

Do you hear the song of the sea?
It’s hurt me, but you hurt more.
Again, I pour a cup of coffee
And let my heart can’t take it anymore.

I have never seen the sea,
I want you to be with me (forever and endlessly).
