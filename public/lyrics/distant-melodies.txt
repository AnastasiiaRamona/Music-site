Hi there!
Once more, I'm far away.
Hi there!
In distant echoes, I stay.

I’m disappearing in the music
And turning into small pixels.
Lost in rhythms so euphoric,
My soul dances, free from shackles.

I'm disappearing in my mind
And listening to old vinyl.
Remembering that I live another life.

I can't turn back the time.
And I don't want to do this.
In the melody's chime,
I find solace and bliss.

I don't go back to past lives.
I'm unsure of what I pursue.
In the haze where uncertainty thrives,
I search for a clearer view.

Hi there! 
Once more, I'm far away.
Hi there!
In the distance, where dreams sway.

This happens when
the soul is torn apart.
Lost in shadows, where echoes spin,
yearning for a fresh start.

This happens when
you crave a new life.
Though it's tough, I find.

I can't turn back the time.
And I don't want to do this.
In the melody's chime,
I find solace and bliss.

I don't go back to past lives.
I'm unsure of what I pursue.
In the haze where uncertainty thrives,
I search for a clearer view.
