You dissolve 
Into these roofs.
They have real proofs.

You’re dancing with the devil.

You’ve always been 
On the run.
Do you remember how it began?

But you're still afraid of heights.

Every day I was the bird who could fly.
The tiny bird who couldn’t say goodbye
To the bright sights and the highest roofs.
The ugly world. I lost my truth.
 
You’re playing with fire.

You need to stop
And forgive yourself
And realize your strength

Without those wings.

I hold a torch in my hands.
I will bring this to an end, end, end.
True wisdom grows only where the need to please has faded.
It’s okay, we’re all afraid of heights, we’re all afraid of heights, we’re all afraid.
