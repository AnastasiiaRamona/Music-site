I remember the path through the fields.
It kept raining in my headphones.
All I had was nothing real.
I remember a friend who is gone.

How many regrets, so many meanings…
This film is very old; it’s melting in the sun.
I think my escape was a part of dreaming,
But I always wanted to run.

Hello, shadow! I keep
My mind open, you see 
The haze
Of growing up.

Hello, hello. We both have changed.
But you exist beyond age.
My friend
Would have been glad.

I chase the echoes of that field,
But I'm afraid it wouldn’t be the same.
I believed this place could heal.
Does this field still hold that pain?

The air hums with electricity.
The big birds aren’t afraid of people.
And it felt like felicity.
Keep your mind simple.

Hello, shadow! You were killed
By a thousand tears.
You still
Believe in me.

Hello, hello, Indian summer.
You carry peace as your power.
Until
We meet again…

Now I've seen real mountains.
But I remember this lonely tree.
So many views, I can’t count them.
It meant a lot to me.

My friend was always saying
That I was kind of sick.
But the dog also liked playing.
I'm very sorry. I feel my guilt.
