Wake up! Every day of my life 
I try, I try, I try.

Wake up! Every day of my life
I close my eyes, my eyes.

Hey brothers, sisters,
Stop me now!
I’m craving to destroy the town.
I’m craving to destroy your hopes.
Stop, stop, stop me and close…

Hey brothers, sisters,
Stop me now!
I’m craving to destroy the town.
I’m craving to destroy your hopes.
Stop, stop, stop me and close

Like the USA, which nobody discovered,
Like a book with an unobvious end.
I don’t want to paint the town red,
I just want to find myself.

Hey brothers, sisters,
Stop me now!
I’m craving to destroy the town.
I’m craving to destroy your hopes.
Stop, stop, stop me and close…

Hey brothers, sisters,
Stop me now!
I’m craving to destroy the town.
I’m craving to destroy your hopes.
Stop, stop,  stop me and close

Many things are hidden from my view.
However, the core of some things can be found only on the outside.
Sometimes it takes two years to understand a decision thoroughly.
And sometimes you don't know who you are for twenty years.
But the most beautiful thing is to comprehend that 
You don’t have to spend twenty years looking for yourself.
You shouldn't let one thing be the meaning of your life.

Like a spam website,
Like your bright eyes.
I don’t want to paint the town red,
I just want to find myself. 

I just want to find myself. 
I just want to find myself. 
I just want to find myself. 
I just want to find myself…
